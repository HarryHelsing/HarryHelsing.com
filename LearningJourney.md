Here's some of what I learned while doing this
- Learned to use some basic HTML
- Learned to style it with CSS
- Learned to use flex boxes
- Tried some basic dynamic elements with Rust and the Yew framework
- Found I did not know enough of the fundamentals to feel comfortable continuing on with Rust and WASM/Yew
- Decided to refocus on fundamentals before reexploring web dev
- In future perhaps I'll try using Rust and WASM without a framework, to try and understand what is going on under the hood before using a framework
- Right now I am focusing on writing good Rust before I expand onto terirory like this
