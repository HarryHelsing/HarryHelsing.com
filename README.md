An attempt at building my own website, mostly for the experience of learning HTML and CSS

An eclectic website to cover my art, coding, spirituality and writing.  
## To-do
- [ ] Create separate CSS style sheet
- [ ] Create multiple pages with menu to move between
- [ ] Allow gallery to adjust depending on screen width
- [ ] Look into different frameworks for using Rust through wasm
